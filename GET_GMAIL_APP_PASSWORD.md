# How to Get a Gmail App Password

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Find "2-Step Verification" under "Signing in to Google"
3. If it's not enabled, click it and follow the prompts to enable it
4. You'll need your phone to verify

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Still on the Security page: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Scroll down to find "App passwords" (under "Signing in to Google")
3. If you don't see it, make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled first
4. Click on "App passwords"
5. You may need to sign in again
6. Select "Mail" from the dropdown
7. Select "Other (Custom name)" from the device dropdown
8. Type "Django Salon Booking" as the name
9. Click "Generate"
10. **Copy the 16-character password** - it will look like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - You can remove the spaces when using it

### Step 3: Use the App Password
- Use this 16-character password (not your regular Gmail password)
- This password is specifically for this application
- Keep it secure - you can revoke it anytime from the App passwords page

## Important Notes
- You CANNOT use your regular Gmail password
- App Passwords only work if 2-Step Verification is enabled
- Each app can have its own App Password
- You can generate multiple App Passwords for different apps
